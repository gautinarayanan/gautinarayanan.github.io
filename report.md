*(This chart shows the distribution of time spent on each type of activity, including DSA practice, Leetcode, job applications, and personal time.)*

**Reflection:**
- This week, I felt good about my progress in DSA and managed to keep up with the job applications. Next week, I plan to focus more on Leetcode problem-solving speed.
