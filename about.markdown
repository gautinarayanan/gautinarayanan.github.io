# About This Site

Welcome! This website is a personal tracker where I log my weekly goals, daily activities, and progress. Itâ€™s designed to help me stay focused on my career goals and skill-building activities.

**Sections:**
- [Weekly Goals](./goals): Lists my specific goals for the week.
- [Daily Logs](./logs): Daily records of wake-up time, weight, tasks, gym time, and more.
- [Weekly Report](./report): A summary of my progress, including charts.
- [Timetable](./timetable): A structured timetable to guide daily tasks and priorities.

Thank you for visiting, and feel free to follow along as I work towards my career goals!
